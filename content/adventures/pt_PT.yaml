                    ## Bem-vindo à Hedy! 
                    No nível 1 pode usar os comandos `{print}`, `{ask}` e `{echo}`. 
                    Escreve o teu código no painel de programação. Ou pressiona o botão verde no bloco do código exemplo, e o código será digitado para ti! 
                    Experimenta o código com o botão verde 'Executar código', por baixo do painel de programação. 
                     
                    Podes imprimir o texto no ecrã usando o comando `{print}`.     
                start_code: "print Olá mundo!"
                example_code: "```\n{print} Olá!\n{print} Bem-vindo a Hedy!\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "You can also ask for input and repeat it back with an `{echo}` command.\nTry the code to your left again.\n\nDon't know what to create? In the next tabs you will find ideas for programs to build.\n"
                example_code_2: "```\n{ask} What is your name?\n{echo} hello\n```\n"

                    No nível 2 vamos aprender algo novo. Podemos atribuir um nome a uma palavra utilizando `is`.

                    Se usares o código `nome is Hedy`, podes colocar nome em qualquer parte do teu código, que será automaticamente substituído por Hedy.
                start_code: "print Olá mundo!"
                story_text_2: "`print` funciona tal e qual como no nível 1 e já não precisas de usar `echo`. Nota: `ask` mudou, também podes guardar a resposta com um nome, da seguinte maneira."
                example_code: "```\nname {is} Hedy\nage {is} 15\n{print} name is age years old\n```\n"

                    ```
                story_text_3: "Outro novo comando neste nível é `{sleep}`, que coloca o program em pausa por um segundo. Se digitares um número antes de {sleep} command, the program pauses for that amount of seconds.\n"
                example_code_3: "```\n{print} My favorite colour is...\n{sleep} 2\n{print} green!\n```\n"

                story_text: |
                    No nível 3 também podes criar uma lista. Podes fazer o computador escolher algo aleatório (ou seja, uma coisa ao calhas) dessa lista. Fazes isso utilizando 'at random'.

                    Encontras todos os códigos do nível 3 na barra esquerda. Temos também separadores com tarefas.
                start_code: "print Olá mundo!"
                example_code: |-
                    ## Exemplo de código Hedy
                     ```
                     animais is cão, gato, canguru
                     print animais at random
                     ```
                story_text_2: You can also add items to the list with `{add}` and remove items with `{remove}`.
                example_code_2: "## Exemplo de código Hedy\n\n```\nanimals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo\n{add} penguin {to_list} animals\n{remove} cat {from} animals\n{print} animals {at} {random}\n```\n"
            4:
                start_code: "print 'Olá mundo!'"
                story_text: |
                    `ask` funciona no nível 4 tal como funcionava no nível 3, mas `print` está diferente agora.

                     Tens de colocar o texto que queres escrever entre aspas simples.

                     Isto é útil, porque agora podes escrever todas as palavras que queres. O mesmo se aplica às palavras com que costumavas guardar algo usando `is`.

                     A maioria das linguagens de programação também usam aspas simples quando querem escrever, por isso, estamos um passo mais próximos da realidade da programação!

                     ## As tarefas estão a ficar cada vez mais difíceis
                     Vais encontrar os comandos à esquerda, novamente, e as tarefas nos separadores seguintes. À medida que avanças pelos separadores, as tarefas vão ficando mais difíceis.
                     Por isso, é melhor começares pela esquerda na história e ires avançando para a direita, para que o desafio vá aumentando, gradualmente.
                example_code: "## Exemplo de código Hedy\n```\nprint 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'\nanswer is ask 'What do we need to use from now on?'\nprint 'We need to use ' answer\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "## Adventures are getting more and more difficult\nThe adventures are now getting more and more difficult in the successive tabs.\nSo it is best to start on the left with the story, and work to the right, in order to be challenged more and more.\n"

                    nome is ask Como te chamas?
                    if nome is Hedy print 'Fixe!' else print 'pff'
                story_text: |
                    `ask` e `print` funcionam como no nível 4.

                     No nível 5 temos algo novo, o `if`! Com o `if` podes escolher entre duas opções diferentes.

                     Este código escreve Fixe! se colocares Hedy como nome e boo! se colocares outra coisa qualquer.

                     ## As tarefas estão a ficar cada vez mais difíceis

                     Também no nível 5 as tarefas que vais encontrar nos separadores estão a tornar-se mais difíceis. Por isso, completa-as da esquerda para a direita.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    nome is ask Como te chamas?
                    if nome is Hedy print 'Fixe!' else print 'boo!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: "## Lists\nWhen we want to check if something is in a list, we can now use the `{in}` command.\nThis code prints pretty! if you choose green or yellow, and meh otherwise.\n"
                example_code_3: "```\npretty_colors {is} green, yellow\ncolor {is} {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'\n{if} color {in} pretty_colors {print} 'pretty!'\n{else} {print} 'meh'\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nname {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'\n{if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice'\n{else} {print} 'boo!'\n```\n"
            6:
                start_code: "print '5 vezes 5 é ' 5 * 5"
                story_text: |
                    `ask`, `print` e `if` ainda funcionam como nos nível 5.
                     Mas no nível 6 temos algo novo, também podes fazer cálculos.

                     No nível 6 acrescentamos novos símbolos e agora tu podes fazer cálculos dentro do teu código.

                     A soma é fácil, escreves tal como fazes em Matemática: `5 + 5`, por exemplo. A subtração também funciona na perfeição, é `5 - 5`.

                     A multiplicação é um pouco diferente, porque não existe o símbolo de multiplicar no teu teclado. Podes procurar à vontade, não existe mesmo!
                     Por esse motivo, multiplicamos utilizando o asterisco: `5 * 5`. Lê isto como 5 vezes 5 e assim será mais fácil memorizar.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    print '5 mais 5 é ' 5 + 5
                    print '5 menos 5 é ' 5 - 5
                    print '5 vezes 5 é ' 5 * 5
                    ```

                story_text_2: "We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:\n"

                start_code: "repeat 3 times print 'Hedy é divertida!'"
                story_text: |
                    `ask`, `print` e `if` funcionam, exactamente, como acontecia no nível 5 e 6.
                    Mas o nível 7 acrescenta o comando `repeat`.  `repeat` pode ser usado para executar uma linha de código múltiplas vezes.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    repeat 3 times print 'Hedy é divertida!'
                    ```
            8:
                start_code: |-
                    repeat 5 times
                        print 'Olá amigos!'
                        print 'Isto vai ser escrito 5 vezes.'
                story_text: |
                    `ask` e `print` ainda funcionam como já conheces. Mas `if` e `repeat` mudaram!
                    Tu podes agora executar grupos de código em conjunto, mas vais ter de indentar o código.
                    Isto significa colocar quatro espaços no início da linha. Isto também se aplica quando quiseres apenas criar um bloco só de uma linha.

                    Se juntares um `repeat` e um `if`, terás de indentar cada bloco. Observa o exemplo de código para mais detalhes!"
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    repeat 5 times
                        print 'Olá a todos!'
                        print 'Tudo isto é repetido 5 vezes.'
                    ```
            9:
                start_code: |-

                        if food is 'pizza'
                            print 'nice!'
                        else
                            print 'pizza is better'
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can not only use multiple lines with `if` and `repeat`, but you can also put them together!
                    In the example you see an `if` command within a `repeat` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `if` is also allowed in an `if` and a `repeat` in a `repeat`.
                    Give it a try!
                example_code: |-
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    In this level we learn a new code called `for`. With `for` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `for` creates a block, like `repeat` and `if` so all lines in the block need to start with spaces.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    animals is dog, cat, blobfish

                    ## Numbers and texts
                    **Decimal numbers**
                    So far, Hedy did not allow for decimal numbers like 1.5, but now we do allow that. Note that computers use the `.` for decimal numbers.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Two and a half plus two and a half is...'

                    **All texts need to be in quotation marks**
                    For this level on you will also have to use quotation marks when storing a text with `=`:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = 'Hedy the Robot'
                    {print} 'Hello ' name
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    **All items in lists need quotation marks too**
                    Lists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.
                    This allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Iron Man'.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    superheroes = 'Spiderman', 'Batman', 'Iron Man'

                story_text_4: |
                    **All text after `{if}` comparisons need quotation marks too**
                example_code_4: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'

                    ```
                story_text_5: |
                    **Numbers don't need quotation marks**
                    For numbers, you do not use quotation marks in the `=`:
                example_code_5: |
                    ```
                    score = 25

                    ## Cria uma história
                    No nível 1 podes criar uma história com um personagem principal diferente, saído da tua imaginação.

                    Como primeira linha, usa este código `{ask}`.

                    Após a primeira linha, começa com `print` se quiseres que a frase seja escrita.
                    Utilizas `echo` se quiseres colocar o teu personagem principal no final da frase.

                example_code: |
                    ## Código de exemplo Hedy
                    ```
                    ask O(A) personagem principal desta história é ...
                    print O(A) personagem principal vai caminhar agora na floresta
                    echo Está um pouco(a) assustado(a) 
                    print Ouve barulhos estranhos por toda a parte
                    print Receia que esta floresta seja assombrada
                    ```

                    ## O que se segue?
                    É uma pena só conseguires criar frases em que o nome do personagem principal aparece no final, certo? Depois de praticarmos com esta história, prossegue para o nível 2 e, a seguir, para o nível 3, onde podes criar programas cada vez mais complexos.

                start_code: "print A tua história começa aqui"
                story_text_2: "## Challenge\nCan you make your own story in Hedy now by using `{print}` , `{ask}` and `{echo}`?\n"
            2:
                story_text: |
                    ## História
                    No nível 2 podes tornar a tua história ainda mais divertida. O nome da tua personagem principal pode agora aparecer em qualquer parte da frase.

                    Precisas de programar algumas coisas extra, para conseguires isso. Tens de atribuir o nome ao teu personagem principal, primeiro de tudo.

                    Depois, podes colocar esse nome em qualquer lugar da frase.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    nome is ask Qual é o nome da tua personagem principal?
                    print nome vai agora correr na floresta
                    print nome está um pouco assustado(a)
                    print Está a ouvir barulhos estranhos por toda a parte
                    print nome receia que esta floresta seja assombrada
                    ```
                start_code: "print A tua história"

                story_text: |
                    ## História
                    Podes ter notado que ainda existe um erro no nível 2.

                    Por acaso, tentaste construir uma frase que continha a palavra nome? E.g. `print o meu nome é nome`.

                    Não funciona nada bem! O que obténs: o meu Manuel é Manuel. Podes consertar isto no nível 3.

                    Precisas usar aspas simples para tudo aquilo que queres escrever.

                start_code: "print 'A tua história será escrita aqui!'"
                example_code: |-
                    ```

                    print 'O nome da personagem principal é' nome
                    print nome 'vai passear pela floresta'
                    print nome 'está um pouco assustado'

                    ## Aleatoriedade
                    Podes também acrescentar algo aleatório à tua história. Pode ser um monstro, um animal ou qualquer outro obstáculo.

                    Podemos fazê-lo da seguinte maneira.

                    ## Random Restaurant
                    Having trouble to decide what you wanna have for dinner? You can let Hedy choose for you!
                    Simply add lists of your favorite (or least favorite) meals and Hedy can randomly choose your dinner.
                    You can also have a bit of fun, by letting Hedy choose the price for your dinner as well! What will you get?

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome to Hedy's Random Restaurant!
                    {print} The only restaurant that will randomly choose your meal and its price for you!
                    starters {is} salad, soup, carpaccio
                    mains {is} pizza, brussels sprouts, spaghetti
                    desserts {is} brownies, ice cream, french cheeses
                    drinks {is} cola, beer, water
                    prices {is} 1 dollar, 10 dollars, 100 dollars

                    In this level you have to use quotation marks when using the `{print}` command.
                    Can you make your code from the previous levels work in this level too by adding the quotation marks?

                    Be careful! In the previous levels apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in this level Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
                    So instead of typing  `{print} Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `{print} 'Today we are serving pizza'`

                    In this level you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.

                example_code: |4

                    You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                    {print} 'Here is our menu:'
                    {print} 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                    main = {ask} 'Which main course would you like?'
                    price = 0
                    {if} main {is} pizza price = 10
                    {if} main {is} lasagne price = 12
                    {if} main {is} spaghetti price = 8
                    {print} 'You have ordered ' main
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    {print} 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'

                story_text_2: |
                    But you can also add many more things to your virtual restaurant, for example more courses.

                    ## Challenge
                    You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                    - {ask} how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                    - add another course?
                    - give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
                    - add a children's menu?
                    - think of other fun things to add?
                example_code_2: |4

                    In this example there are three courses, which requires more code and more additions in calculating the price.

                    ## Haunted House
                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Escape from the haunted house!'
                    {print} 'There are 3 doors in front of you...'
                    doors {is} 1, 2, 3
                    monsters {is} werewolf, mummy, vampire, zombie
                    chosen_door {is} {ask} 'Which door do you choose?'
                    {print} 'You chose door...' chosen_door
                    {sleep}
                    correct_door {is} doors {at} {random}
                    {if} chosen_door {is} correct_door {print} 'Great! Youve escaped!'
                    {else} {print} 'Oh no! You are being eaten by a...' monsters {at} {random}
                    ```

                    In this level you can use nesting, which allows you to make the haunted house even more interactive!

                    ## Challenge
                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
                    For example by only having 1 wrong door and 2 correct doors instead of 1 correct door and 2 wrong ones?
