                    हेडी मे आपका स्वागत है! स्तर १ में आप `{print}`, `{ask}` और `{echo}` जैसे आदेशों  का उपयोग कर सकते है।
                    उदाहरण के लिए, आप `{print}` का उपयोग करके स्क्रीन पर टेक्स्ट प्रिंट कर सकते हैं। आप एक उदाहरण देख सकते हैं
                    बाईं ओर कोड स्निपेट।

                    कोड ब्लॉक में हरा बटन दबाएं, और कोड आपके लिए टाइप हो जाएगा!
                    प्रोग्रामिंग फील्ड के नीचे हरे 'रन कोड' बटन के साथ कोड को स्वयं आज़माएं।

                    आप इनपुट के लिए भी पूछ सकते हैं और इसे `{echo}` कमांड के साथ दोहरा सकते हैं।
                    कोड को अपनी बाईं ओर फिर से आज़माएं।

                    स्तर २ में हम कुछ नया सीखते हैं। आप `{is}` वाले शब्द को नाम दे सकते हैं। आप अपने कोड में कहीं भी नाम का उपयोग कर सकते हैं और इसे हेडी से बदल दिया जाएगा, जैसे:


                    नोट: `{ask}` बदल गया है, आप उत्तर को एक नाम से भी इस तरह सेव करें:

                    प्रिंट अभी भी स्तर १ की तरह काम करता है, और अब आपको `{echo}` की आवश्यकता नहीं है।

                    इस स्तर में एक और नया आदेश `स्लीप` है, जो आपके कार्यक्रम को एक सेकंड के लिए रोक देता है। यदि आप {sleep} कमांड के पीछे एक नंबर टाइप करते हैं, तो प्रोग्राम इतने सेकंड के लिए रुक जाता है।

                story_text_2: "`{print}` still works the same, but the `{ask}` command has changed. You need to use a variable in the `{ask}` command as well. It looks like this:\n"

                    स्तर 3 में आप एक सूची भी बना सकते हैं। आप कंप्यूटर को सूची से कुछ यादृच्छिक चुनने दे सकते हैं। आप इसे `at random` के साथ करते हैं।

                    आप सूची में वस्तु को `add` के साथ जोड़ सकते हैं और `remove` के साथ वस्तु हटा सकते हैं।

                    स्तर ४ में `{ask}` और `{print}` बदल गए हैं।

                    आपको वह टेक्स्ट डालना होगा जिसे आप उद्धरण चिह्नों के बीच प्रिंट करना चाहते हैं।

                    यह उपयोगी है, क्योंकि अब आप अपने इच्छित सभी शब्दों को प्रिंट कर सकते हैं। साथ ही जिन शब्दों को आप `{is}` के साथ स्टोर करते थे।

                    अधिकांश प्रोग्रामिंग भाषाएं प्रिंट करते समय उद्धरण चिह्नों का भी उपयोग करती हैं, इसलिए हम वास्तविक प्रोग्रामिंग के करीब भी एक कदम आगे बढ़ रहे हैं!

                    ## कार्यभार अधिक कठिन होते जा रहे हैं
                    आपको फिर से बाईं ओर कमांड और निम्नलिखित टैब में कार्यभार मिलेंगे। लगातार टैब में कार्यभार अब और अधिक कठिन होते जा रहे हैं।
                    इसलिए कहानी के साथ बाईं ओर शुरू करना और दाईं ओर काम करना सबसे अच्छा है, ताकि अधिक से अधिक चुनौती दी जा सके।
                example_code: "```\nprint 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'\nanswer is ask 'What do we need to use from now on?'\nprint 'We need to use ' answer\n```\n"

                story_text: |-
                    `{ask}` {and} `{print}` अभी भी वैसे ही काम करते हैं जैसे उन्होंने स्तर 4 में किया था।

                     स्तर 5 में कुछ नया है, `{if}`! `{if}` से आप दो अलग-अलग विकल्पों में से चुन सकते हैं।


                     यह कोड अच्छा प्रिंट करता है यदि आप हेडी को एक नाम के रूप में दर्ज करते हैं, और बू! अगर आप कुछ और दर्ज करते हैं।

                     जब हम यह जांचना चाहते हैं कि सूची में कुछ है या नहीं, तो अब हम वस्तु और सूची के बीच 'in' का उपयोग कर सकते हैं।

                    यह कोड सुंदर प्रिंट करता है! यदि आप हरा या पीला चुनते हैं, और मेह अन्यथा।

                     स्तर 5 में भी, टैब में असाइनमेंट अधिक से अधिक कठिन होते जा रहे हैं। तो, उन्हें बाएं से दाएं करें।
                example_code: |-

                story_text: |-
                    `{ask}`, `{print}` और `{if}` अभी भी स्तर 5 की तरह काम करते हैं।
                     लेकिन स्तर 6 में आप कुछ नया सीखते हैं: अब आप गणना भी कर सकते हैं।

                    जोड़ आसान है, आप इसे गणित के जैसे लिखते हैं: उदाहरण के लिए `5 + 5`। घटाव भी ठीक काम करता है, यह `5 - 5` है।

                    {times} थोड़ा अलग है, क्योंकि आपके कीबोर्ड पर कोई {times} चिन्ह नहीं है। बस खोजें, वास्तव में ऐसा नहीं है!
                     इसलिए हम 8 के ऊपर के तारक से गुणा करते हैं: `5 * 5` । इसे "5 गुना 5" के रूप में पढ़ें जो आपको इसे सबसे अच्छी तरह याद रखने में मदद करता है।


                     हम भंडारण में भी बदलाव करते हैं! जब हम कोई नाम या नंबर इस तरह से स्टोर करते हैं, तो अब आप `{is}` के बदले `=` का उपयोग कर सकते हैं:
                example_code_2: |-
                    ```
                    नाम = हेडी

                    इसका मतलब है कि लाइन की शुरुआत में चार रिक्त स्थान डालने होंगे |
                    यह तब भी लागू होगा जब आप केवल एक पंक्ति का एक ब्लॉक बनाना चाहते हैं| जब आप केवल एक पंक्ति का ब्लॉक बनाना चाहते हैं तो आपको इंडेंट भी करना होगा।

                    इस स्तर पर आप न केवल `{if}` {and} `{repeat}` के साथ कई पंक्तियों का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, बल्कि आप उन्हें एक साथ भी रख सकते हैं!
                    उदाहरण में आप एक `{if}` कमांड को `{repeat}` कमांड में देखते हैं। इसे दूसरे तरीके से भी अनुमति दी जाती है, और एक `{if}` में एक `{if}` और `{repeat}` में `{repeat}` की भी अनुमति है।
                    इसे आज़माइए!

                    यदि आप यह जांचना चाहते हैं कि पहली संख्या छोटी है या दूसरी के बराबर है, तो आप `<=` का उपयोग कर सकते हैं, उदाहरण के लिए `आयु <= 11`।
                    `>` जांचता है कि पहली संख्या दूसरी से बड़ी है या नहीं, उदाहरण के लिए `अंक > 10` जांचता है कि `अंक` 10 से बड़ा है या नहीं।

                    इस स्तर पर आप अलग-अलग अंत को प्रोग्राम कर सकते हैं, जो आपकी कहानी को और भी मजेदार बना देगा।

                    उदाहरण के लिए, अपनी कहानी के दो अंत के बारे में सोचें:

                    - राजकुमारी जंगल से घूम रही है
                    - उसका सामना एक राक्षस से होता है

                    - सुखद अंत: वह अपनी तलवार लेती है और राक्षस जल्दी से भाग जाता है
                    - बुरा अंत: राक्षस राजकुमारी को खा जाता है

                    आप यह भी सुनिश्चित कर सकते हैं कि एक नाम फिर से दर्ज किया जा सकता है। यह पिछले स्तरों की तरह ही काम करता है। आप इसे एक `{if}` के साथ जोड़ सकते हैं, और फिर आप पहले से ही एक पूरा प्रोग्राम बना चुके हैं!

                    ## Let's draw
                    In level 1 you can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or a stair!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} right` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} left` turns counter clockwise.

                    This is the start of a little staircase. Can you make it have 5 steps?
                example_code: |

                    {turn} right

                    {turn} left

                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `{repeat}`.

                    angle = 90

                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!

                    ## Dishwashing
                    With the `{repeat}` you can repeat pieces of code. You can use this to calculate who will be washing dishes for the entire week.
                start_code: "{print} 'Who does the dishes?'"
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'the dishwasher is' _
                    ```
            6:

                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes = 0
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    {if} dishwasher {is} Emma emma_washes = emma_washes + 1
                    {print} 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?

                    ## Make it fair
                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to to the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And... can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?

                    In this level we can determine who won.
                    For that you need the new `{if}` code.

                    Save your choice with the name of choice and the choice of computer as computer choice.
                    Then you can use `{if}` to see {if} they are the same or different.

                    In level 2 you could expand your restaurant by using variables. In level 1 Hedy could only {echo} the order once and only remember the last thing that was ordered.
                    Now you can use variables and Hedy can remember both the food and the drinks!

                    Having trouble to decide what you wanna have for dinner? You can let Hedy choose for you!
                    Simply add lists of your favorite (or least favorite) meals and Hedy can randomly choose your dinner.
                    You can also have a bit of fun, by letting Hedy choose the price for your dinner as well! What will you get?

                    In this level you have to use quotation marks when using the `{print}` command.
                    Can you make your code from the previous levels work in this level too by adding the quotation marks?

                    Be careful! In the previous levels apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in this level Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
                    So instead of typing  `{print} Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `{print} 'Today we are serving pizza'`

                    In this level you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.

                example_code: |4

                    You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                    {print} 'Here is our menu:'
                    {print} 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                    main = {ask} 'Which main course would you like?'
                    price = 0
                    {if} main {is} pizza price = 10
                    {if} main {is} lasagne price = 12
                    {if} main {is} spaghetti price = 8
                    {print} 'You have ordered ' main
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    {print} 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'

                story_text_2: |
                    But you can also add many more things to your virtual restaurant, for example more courses.

                    ## Challenge
                    You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                    - {ask} how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                    - add another course?
                    - give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
                    - add a children's menu?
                    - think of other fun things to add?
                example_code_2: |4

                    In this example there are three courses, which requires more code and more additions in calculating the price.

                    In the previous levels you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                    Now that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.
                    In the next example you can have your fortune teller {ask} 3 questions and also print them!

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?

                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                    Every time the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                    This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                    By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                    This does mean that you can only use `{repeat}` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions separately.
                    Can you do it?

                    In the upcoming levels the layout of {repeat} command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                    Of course this might raise some suspicion with the other players... To avoid that, you can make sure that Hedy does give different answers every time you run the code.
                    But of course, still gives you a positive answer and the other players a negative one.

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I can predict how many kids youll get when you grow up!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    siblings = {ask} 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'
                    {sleep}
                    {print} kids ' kids!'
                    ```

                    ## Example Silly Fortune Teller
                    If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I will predict how smart you are!'
                    football = {ask} 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
                    bananas = {ask} 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
                    hygiene = {ask} 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                    result = bananas + hygiene
                    result = result * football
                    {print} 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'
                    ```

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    This level has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
                    You can remake your level 3 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 3, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ## Challenges
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or '{ask} again'.

                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    The next level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in the next level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.

                    Congratulations! You've reached the end of level 1. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes, but Hedy has a lot more to discover. 

                    In the first level you might've notice that the `{echo}` command can only save one bit of information at a time. 
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could {echo} what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence. 

                    ```
                    {print} Welcome at Hedy's
                    {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {echo} So you want 
                    {ask} what would you like to drink?
                    {echo} So you want 
                    ```
                    If the player types a hamburger and coke, you can't say `so you would like a hamburger and coke`, but you have to make two separate line. 
                    Also, the `{echo}` command only echoes the word at the end of the sentence. So you can't say `your hamburger is coming right up!`.

                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
                    So let's go to the next level!

                    ## What's next?
                    In this level you've learned what a variable is and how you can use it to make your adventures more interactive.
                    But... that's not the only thing you can do with variables! You can also use variables to make lists.
                    And you can even let Hedy pick a random word out of a list, which allows you to make real games!
                    Take a quick look at the next level!

                    ## What's next?
                    In the previous levels you've already learned to use `{at} {random}` which made your games different every time you ran the code.
                    But it's not really interactive, the player doesn't have any influence on what happens in the game.

                    In the next level you'll learn the `{if}` command, that allows you to give different responses in your program. This way you can program a secret password for your computer for example.
                    So let's take a peak!

                    ```
                    password {is} {ask} 'What is the correct password?'
                    ```
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    In this level you've been practising with variables, but maybe you've come across this mistake.

                    Try to run this code:
                    ```
                    name {is} Sophie
                    {print} My name is name
                    ```
                    Of course you wanted to print `My name is Sophie` but Hedy prints `My Sophie is Sophie`. 
                    In the next level this problem is fixed by using quotation marks.
                start_code: "{print} Let's go to the next level!"
            6:
                start_code: "{print} 'On to the next level!'"
                story_text: |
                    ## What's next?
                     Great job! You've reached the end of this level, which means you have practiced with `{if}` and `{else}`. You have probably noticed that your codes are getting longer and longer.
                     For example {if} you want to program 'Happy Birthday'

                     ```
                     {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                     {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                     {print} 'happy birthday dear Hedy'
                     {print} 'happy birthday to you'

                     ```
                     That's a lot of code for mainly the same words over and over again. Luckily in the next level has a solution with the `{repeat}` command, that allows you to repeat a line of code multiple times.
                example_code: " ```\n {print} 'happy birthday to you'\n {print} 'happy birthday to you'\n {print} 'happy birthday dear Hedy'\n {print} 'happy birthday to you'\n ```\n"

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you've learned how to repeat one single line of code. This comes in handy, but it's not always enough. Sometimes you want to repeat multiple lines at once.
                    the next level allows you to group a couple of lines of code, and repeat that little group of lines all at once!

                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'In the next level you can repeat multiple lines of code at once!'
                    ```
                example_code: "```\n{repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'In the next level you can repeat multiple lines of code at once!'\n```\n"
            8:
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"
                story_text: |
                    ## What's next?
                    Great job! You've reached the end of another level! In this level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an {if} or {repeat} command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In the next level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command.

                    For example:
                    ```
                    answer = {ask} 'Would you like to go to teh next level?'
                    {if} answer {is} 'yes'
                        {print} 'Great! You can use the {repeat} commando in the {if} command!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Okay, you can stay here for a little longer!'
                    ```
                    In this code Hedy will still say 'Your drink is on its way' even {if} you didn't even want to drink something! In the next level this will be fixed!
                example_code: "```\nanswer = {ask} 'Would you like to go to the next level?'\n{if} answer {is} yes\n    {print} 'Great! You can use the {repeat} commando in the {if} command!'\n    {print} 'Hooray!'\n    {print} 'Hooray!'\n    {print} 'Hooray!'\n{else}\n    {print} 'Okay, you can stay here for a little longer!'\n```\n"

                    ## What's next?
                    You're doing great! In this level we still face a small problem. You have learned to repeat lines, but what {if} you'd want to slightly change the line.
                    For example {if} you want to sing the song '{if} you're happy and you knwo it'

                    It would look like this:
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times}
                        {print} '{if} youre happy and you know it clap your hands'
                    {print} '{if} youre happy and you know it and you really want to show it'
                    {print} '{if} youre happy and you know it clap your hands'
                    ```

                    If you'd also want the next verse 'stomp your feet', and the next one, and the next one, you'd have to change the code completely.
                    In the next level you'll learn the `{for}` command, which allows you to make a list of actions and repeat the code with another action each time!
                    Please take a look!
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"
                example_code: "```\n{repeat} 2 {times}\n    {print} '{if} youre happy and you know it clap your hands'\n{print} '{if} youre happy and you know it and you really want to show it'\n{print} '{if} youre happy and you know it clap your hands'\n```\n"

                    You have reached the end of this level, you're doing great! You are about to go to the next level. In the higher levels, Hedy is focussing more and more on teaching you the programming language Python.
                    In Python there is no `{repeat}` command, but there is a command that works like {repeat}. Are you curious to find out how to say `{repeat}` in Python language? Quickly go on to find out!

                    ## What's next?
                    Maybe you have tried using decimal numbers in your restaurant adventure. If you did, you probably noticed that Hedy didn't understand them yet and always rounded off.
                    From the next level on you can use decimal numbers.

                    Another cool feauture in the next level is that you can use mulitiple words in a variable.
                    For intance, you could already do this...
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'Who is your favorite cartoon character?'
                    {print} 'I love watching ' name
                    ```
                    But you couldn't use multiple words in a variable like the example below. This program does not work yet in this level!
                    ```
                    show = SpongeBob SquarePants
                    {print} show 'is my favorite show!'
                    ```
                    Go to the next level to make this code work!
                example_code: "```\nname = {ask} 'Who is your favorite cartoon character?'\n{print} 'I love watching ' name\n```\nBut you couldn't use multiple words in a variable like the example below. This program does not work yet in this level!\n```\nshow = SpongeBob SquarePants\n{print} show 'is my favorite show!'\n```\nGo to the next level to make this code work!\n"

                    ## What's next?
                    In the previous levels you learned how to put two `{if}`commands inside each other. This works fine, but it does give you very long and unhandy codes like this one:
                    ```
                    username {is} {ask} 'What is your username?'
                    password {is} {ask} 'What is your password?'
                    {if} username {is} 'Hedy'
                        {if} password {is} 'secret'
                            {print} 'Welcome Hedy!'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Access denied'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Access denied!'
                    ```
                    In this system you have to give both the correct username and the correct password.
                    In the next level you will learn the `{and}` command that will make this code a ot shorter and more understandable!
                    Check it out!
                example_code: "```\nusername {is} {ask} 'What is your username?'\npassword {is} {ask} 'What is your password?'\n{if} username {is} 'Hedy'\n    {if} password {is} 'secret'\n        {print} 'Welcome Hedy!'\n    {else}\n        {print} 'Access denied'\n{else}\n    {print} 'Access denied!'\n```\n"

                    In the next level we will grow a bit more towards real Python code. thon code. You will also learn how to match two lists together.
                    This way you can program a code in which the correct animal is matched to the right sound.
                    Because the two codes below... Are obviously nonsense!
                    ```
                    animals = 'chicken', 'horse', 'cow'
                    sounds = 'cluck', 'neigh', 'moo'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {print} 'A ' animal ' says ' sounds {at} {random}
                    ```
                    You could also try to make it work this way, but....
                    ```
                    animals = 'chicken', 'horse', 'cow'
                    sounds = 'cluck', 'neigh', 'moo'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {for} sound {in} sounds
                            {print} 'A ' animal ' says ' sound
                    ```

                    ## What's next?
                    In the next level it's time for a new command. You might have noticed in the previous levels that `{if}` and `{else}` sometimes aren't enough.
                    For example in this code:
                    ```
                    {print} 'What is for dinner tonight?'
                    options = ['pizza', 'broccoli', 'green beans']
                    chosen = options {at} {random}
                    {if} chosen = pizza
                        {print} 'Yummy! Pizza!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Yikes...'
                    ```
                    In this code it would be great to have 2x an `{else}` so you could have one option for the broccoli and one for the green beans. The next level comes with the new command `{elif}` that makes this possible!
                    So check out the next level now!
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.
                start_code: "{print} 'Baby shark'"
                story_text_2: "## 5 Little Monkeys jumping on the bed\nThis children's song counts down from 5 little monkeys to 1 monkey.\nIf you copy line 2 - 7 and paste it under the the code, you can sing the whole song!\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nnumber = 6\nnumber = number - 1\nprint number ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'\nprint 'One fell off and bumped his head'\nprint 'Mama called the doctor and the doctor said'\nprint 'NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED!'\nsleep\n```\n"

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.
                start_code: "{print} 'Baby Shark'"

                    ## Songs
                    In a previous level you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. You made one verse and then had to copy the verses 99 times. In level 7 you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99

                    In this level you can easily make the childrens' song 'Five little monkeys'. Can you make the last chorus?
                    You can also make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines!
                    Or you can make Old McDonald with all the different animals.

                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but {if} not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and {ask} the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.

                    In the previous levels you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In this level you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!

                    ## Challenge
                    This story is pretty straight {forward}, maybe you can spook it up a bit by adding a more exciting story.
                    Also you have very limited outcomes right now, there are only 3 options of what's behind the doors. Maybe you can think of more monsters to add to the list!

                    ## Change the game into a tv gameshow!
                    Lastly, we'd like to challenge you to change this game into a gameshow (like the ones on tv) where you choose a door or suitcase and it contains a big price!
                    Can you do it?

                    ## Haunted House
                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Escape from the haunted house!'

                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
