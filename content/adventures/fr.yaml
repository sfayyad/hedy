                    ## Bienvenue Hedy !
                    Au niveau 1, tu peux utiliser les commandes `{print}`,`{ask}` et `{echo}`.
                    Ecris ton code dans le programme field. Ou appuie sur le bouton vert dans l'exemple du bloc de code et le code se fera automatiquement pour toi !
                    Essaye le code toi-même avec le bouton vert "executer le code"situé sous le champ de programmation.

                    Tu peux afficher du texte à l'écran en utilisant la commande `{print}`.
                start_code: "{print} bonjour le monde !"
                example_code: "```\n{print} Bonjour !\n{print} Bienvenue sur Hedy !\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "Tu peux aussi demander une entrée avec `{ask}` et la répété avec une commande `{echo}`.\n"
                example_code_2: "```\n{ask} Quel est ton nom ?\n{echo} hello\n```\n"
                story_text_3: "Commençons  ! Tu ne sais pas quoi créer ? Tu trouveras des idées de programmes à réaliser dans les onglets suivants.\n"

                    ## Variables
                    Au niveau 2, nous apprenons deux nouvelles comandes : `{is}` et `{sleep}`.  
                    Tu peux nommer un mot avec `{is}`. C'est ce que l'on appelle une variable. Dans cet exemple, on a fait une variable appelé nom et une variable appelé age. Tu peux utiliser le mot nom n'importe où dans ton code et il sera remplacé par Hedy comme cela :

                    De cette manière, tu n'as plus besoin de la commande `{echo}` !
                start_code: "{print} bonjour le monde !"
                story_text_2: "`{print}` fonctionne toujours de la même manière, mais la commande `{ask}` a changé. Tu as besoin d’une variable pour stocker la réponse. Voici à quoi cela ressemble :\n"
                example_code: "```\nname {is} Hedy\nage {is} 15\n{print} name is age years old\n```\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nreponse {is} {ask} Comment t'appelles-tu ?\n{print} Salut reponse\n```\n"
                story_text_3: "Une autre nouvelle commande de ce niveau est `{sleep}`, qui te permet de mettre le programme en pause pendant un certain temps. Lorsque tu tapes un chiffre après la commande {sleep}, le programme s’interrompt pendant ce nombre de secondes.\n"
                example_code_3: "```\n{print} Ma couleur préférée est...\n{sleep} 2\n{print} le vert !\n```\n"
            3:
                story_text: |
                    ## Fais une liste !
                    Au niveau 3, tu peux faire une liste. tu peux ensuite laisser l'ordinateur choisir au hasard dans la liste. tu fais cela avec `{at} {random}`.
                start_code: "{print} bonjour le monde !"
                example_code: "```\nanimals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo\n{print} animals {at} {random}\n```\n"
                story_text_2: Dans ce niveau, tu peux aussi ajouter des éléments à une liste par la commande `{add}` et en supprimer avec la commande `{remove}`.
                example_code_2: "```\nanimals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo\n{add} penguin {to_list} animals\n{remove} cat {from} animals\n{print} animals {at} {random}\n```\n"
            4:
                start_code: "{print} 'Bonjour le monde'"

                    ## 'Quotation marks'
                    `{print}` et `{ask}` changent au niveau 4.  

                    Vous devez placer le texte que vous souhaitez imprimer entre guillemets.  

                    Ceci est utile, car vous pouvez désormais imprimer tous les mots souhaités. Aussi les mots que vous avez utilisés pour stocker quelque chose avec `{is}`.  

                    La plupart des langages de programmation utilisent aussi les guillemets lors des affichages, donc on fait un pas de plus en direction de la vraie programmation.
                story_text_2: "## Les aventures deviennent de plus en plus difficiles  \nD’onglet en onglet, les aventures deviennent de plus en plus difficiles.  \nAlors commence par la gauche et poursuit vers la droite pour être toujours plus mis au défi.\n"
                example_code: "```\n{print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'\nanswer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'\n{print} 'We need to use ' answer\n```\n"
            5:
                start_code: |-
                    nom {is} {ask} 'quel est ton nom?'
                    {if} nom {is} Hedy {print} 'cool!' {else} {print} 'mouais'
                story_text: |
                    ## if... else...
                    Au niveau 5, il y a quelque chose de nouveau, le `{if}` ! If est l'anglais pour si. Avec le `{if}`, vous pouvez choisir entre deux options différentes.
                    Ce code imprime cool ! si vous entrez Hedy comme nom, et moins amusant ! si vous entrez autre chose.
                    `{ask}` et `{print}` fonctionnent toujours comme au niveau 4.
                example_code: "```\nname {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'\n{if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice' {else} {print} 'boo!'\n```\n"
                story_text_3: "## Listes\nPour vérifier si quelque chose est dans une liste, tu peux maintenant utiliser la commande `{in}`.\nCe code renvoie joli ! si tu choisis vert ou jaune, sinon il renvoie mouais.\n"
                example_code_3: "```\njolies_couleurs {is} vert, jaune\ncouleur_préférée {is} {ask} 'Quelle est ta couleur préférée ?'\n{if} couleur_préférée {in} jolies_couleurs {print} 'joli !'\n{else} {print} 'mouais'\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "Parfois, le code avec un `{if}` devient vraiment long et ne tient plus très bien dans la zone de texte. Tu peux alors le répartir sur deux lignes en commençant la seconde au `{else}`, comme ceci :\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nnom {is} {ask} 'quel est ton nom ?'\n{if} nom {is} Hedy {print} 'chouette'\n{else} {print} 'moins amusant !'\n```\n"
            6:
                start_code: "{print} '5 fois 5 font ' 5 * 5"
                story_text: |
                    ## 1 + 1
                     Dans ce niveau, vous apprenez quelque chose de nouveau : vous pouvez maintenant aussi calculer.

                     Le plus est facile, vous l'écrivez comme en mathématiques : `5 + 5` par exemple. Le moins fonctionne aussi très bien, c'est `5 - 5`.

                     Le temps est un peu différent, car il n'y a pas de symbole de temps sur votre clavier. Cherchez, il n'y en a vraiment pas !
                     C'est pourquoi nous multiplions avec l'astérisque au-dessus de 8 : `5 * 5`. Lisez cela comme "5 fois 5", cela vous aidera à mieux vous en souvenir.
                example_code: "```\n{print} '5 plus 5 font ' 5 + 5\n{print} '5 moins 5 font ' 5 - 5\n{print} '5 fois 5 font ' 5 * 5\n```\n"
                story_text_2: "Nous apportons également un changement dans le stockage d'un mot dans une variable ! Vous pouvez maintenant utiliser `=` au lieu de `{is}` lorsque nous stockons un nom ou un nombre dans une variable, comme ceci :\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nnom = Hedy\nréponse = 20 + 4\n```\n"
            7:
                start_code: "{repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'Hedy est amusant!'"
                story_text: |
                    ## Niveau 7 ! Niveau 7 !
                    Le niveau 7 ajoute la commande `{repeat}`.  `{repeat}` peut être utilisé pour exécuter une ligne de code plusieurs fois.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'Hedy est amusant!'
                    ```
            8:
                start_code: |-
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Bonjour les amis'
                        {print} 'Ceci sera affiché 5 fois'
                story_text: |
                    ## Indentation
                    `{ask}` et `{print}` fonctionnent comme tu y es habitué. Mais `{if}`, `{else}` et `{repeat}` ont changé !
                    Tu peux maintenant exécuter des groupes de commandes ensemble, mais tu dois indenter ces commandes.
                    Cela veut dire que tu dois mettre 4 espaces au début des lignes. Tu devras aussi indenter même si tu veux créer un bloc d'une seule ligne.
                example_code: |
                    Voici comment la commande `{repeat}` fonctionne maintenant :
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Bonjour les amis'
                        {print} 'Ceci sera affiché 5 fois'
                    ```
                    Voici comment les commandes `{if}` et `{else}` fonctionnent maintenant :

                    ```
                    nom {is} {ask} 'Quel est ton prénom ?'
                    {if} nom {is} Hedy
                        {print} 'Bonjour Hedy'
                        {print} 'Tu peux jouer sur ton ordinateur !'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'IMPOSTEUR !'
                        {print} 'Tu ne peux pas utiliser cet ordinateur !'
                    ```
            9:
                start_code: |-
                    {repeat} 3 {times}
                        nourriture = {ask} 'Que veux-tu manger?'
                        {if} nourriture {is} pizza
                            {print} 'Super!'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'La pizza est meilleure'
                story_text: |
                    ## tous ensemble maintenant !
                    Dans ce niveau, tu peux non seulement utiliser plusieurs lignes avec `{if}` et `{repeat}`  mais tu peux aussi les mettre ensemble !
                    Dans cet exemple, tu vois une commande `{if}` à l'intérieur d'une commande `{repeat}`. C'est aussi possible dans l'autre sens et un `{if}` est aussi autorisé dans un `{if}` et un `{repeat}` dans un `{repeat}`.
                    Essaie pour voir !

                example_code: "```\n{repeat} 3 {times}\n    nourriture = {ask} 'Que veux tu manger ?'\n    {if} nourriture {is} pizza\n        {print} 'cool!'\n    {else}\n        {print} 'je préfère la pizza'\n```\n"

                    ## Pour chaque élément de la liste...
                    Dans ce niveau, on apprend in nouveau morceau de code appelé `{for}`. Avec `{for}`, tu peux faire une liste et utiliser tous ses éléments.
                    `{for}` créer un block, comme `{repeat}` et `{if}` donc toutes les lignes du block sont indentées.
                example_code: "```\nanimals {is} dog, cat, blobfish\n{for} animal {in} animals\n  {print} 'I love ' animal\n```\n"

                story_text: "## Loops !  \n`{print}` fonctionne encore comme avant, mais on a ajouté une nouvelle forme pour le `{for}`. Tu peux maintenant taper `{for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 5` et utiliser `counter` dans ton programme.  \nEssaie le et regarde le résultat ! Rappelle toi que tu dois encore toujours indenter toutes les lignes après les `{for}` et les `{if}` (cela signifie qu'elles doivent commencer par quatre espaces)"

                    ## Make a story
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    In the first line, use `{ask}` and ask who the main character of the story will be.

                    After that first line, start with `{print}` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `{echo}` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} The main character of this story is

                    ## Story
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.
                example_code: |-
                    ```

                    In level 3 you can make your story more fun. You can use randomness for any monster, animal or other obstacle, like this:

                    ```
                    animals {is} 🦔, 🐿, 🦉, 🦇

                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} He hears a sound
                    animals {is} 🐿, 🦔, 🦇, 🦉
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?

                    {print} it was a animals {at} {random}

                    You may have noticed that there is still a problem in the previous levels. Did you try to print a sentence that contained the word name?
                    You can solve that in this level. You must use quotation marks for everything that you are going to print.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hans

                    ## Story
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `{if}`, and then you have already made a whole program!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name 'walks through the forest'
                    {print} name 'encounter a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats' name
                    ```

                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    {repeat} 5 {times} {print} 'Help!'
                    {print} 'Why is nobody helping me?'

                    ## Story
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'

                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        {print} 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!🦖'

                    In this level you can use nesting to put {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands inside other {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'

                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game {is} 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword {is} 'lost'` so the player can't continu the game until they have found something.

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.
                start_code: "{print} 'Baby shark'"
                story_text_2: "## 5 Little Monkeys jumping on the bed\nThis children's song counts down from 5 little monkeys to 1 monkey.\nIf you copy line 2 - 7 and paste it under the the code, you can sing the whole song!\n"
                example_code_2: "```\nnumber = 6\nnumber = number - 1\nprint number ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'\nprint 'One fell off and bumped his head'\nprint 'Mama called the doctor and the doctor said'\nprint 'NO MORE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED!'\nsleep\n```\n"

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99

                    ## Let's draw
                    You can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or stairs!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.
                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`

                    This is the start of a little staircase. Can you make it have 5 steps?

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} {right}
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} {left}
                    {forward} 50
                    ```

                    ## Turtle
                    In this level you can use variables to make the turtle interactive. For example you can ask the player how many steps the turtle must make.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} How many steps should the turtle make?
                    {forward} answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.
                    Can you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Drawing figures

                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25
                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 25

                    ## Searching turtle
                    In this level you can use use `{at} {random}` with the drawing turtle. A random choice makes the turtle walk a different path each time.
                    Use `{at} {random}` to choose a value from a list. You can copy and paste lines 2 and 3 to create a longer random path.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angles {is} 10, 50, 90, 150, 250

                    ## Let's draw
                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angles = {ask} 'How many angles do you want?'
                    angle = 360 / angles

                    {turn} angle
                    {forward} 50
                    {turn} angle

                    ## Let's draw
                    In this level you can repeat one line of code with `{repeat}`.

                    {print} 'Draw figures'

                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `{repeat}`.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angle = 90
                    {repeat} 10 {times}
                        {turn} angle

                    With the `{if}` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!

                    {print} 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?

                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to to the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And... can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?

                    ## Dice
                    In this level we can choose from a list. With that we can let the computer choose one side of the die.
                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.
                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.
                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    ## Dice
                    You can also make a die again in this level using the `{if}`.
                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm.

                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something {else}.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices {is} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    throw {is} _
                    {print} 'you have' _ 'thrown'
                    {if} _ {is} earthworm {print} 'You can stop throwing.' _ {print} 'You have to hear it again!'

                    ## Dice
                    You can also make an Earthworm die again in this, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.
                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    choices = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points = 0
                    throw = choices {at} {random}
                    {print} 'you threw' throw
                    {if} throw {is} earthworm points = points + 5 {else} points = points + throw
                    {print} 'those are' points ' point'
                    ```
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.
                example_code_2: |
                    ## Looking forward

                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                    You can also make a die again in level 5. With the `{repeat}` code you can easily roll a whole hand of dice.
                    Try to finish the sample code! The dashes should contain multiple commands and characters.

                    But maybe you want to make a completely different die. Of course you can!

                    Simply add lists of your favorite (or least favorite) meals and Hedy can randomly choose your dinner.
                    You can also have a bit of fun, by letting Hedy choose the price for your dinner as well! What will you get?

                    ## Restaurant
                    In this level you have to use quotation marks when using the `{print}` command.
                    Can you make your code from the previous levels work in this level too by adding the quotation marks?

                    Be careful! In the previous levels apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in this level Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
                    So instead of typing  `{print} Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `{print} 'Today we are serving pizza'`

                    {print} 'Here is our menu:'

                    price = 0
                    {if} main {is} pizza price = 10

                    {if} main {is} spaghetti price = 8
                    {print} 'You have ordered ' main
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    {print} 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'

                    You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                    - {ask} how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                    - add another course?
                    - give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
                    - add a children's menu?
                    - think of other fun things to add?
                example_code_2: |4

                    In this example there are three courses, which requires more code and more additions in calculating the price.
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                    {print} 'Here is our menu:'
                    {print} 'Our starters are salad, soup, or carpaccio'
                    {print} 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                    {print} 'Our desserts are brownie, icecream, or milkshake'
                    starter = {ask} 'Which starter would you like to have?'
                    main = {ask} 'Which main course would you like?'
                    dessert = {ask} 'Which dessert do you pick?'
                    price = 0
                    {if} starter {is} soup price = price + 6 {else} price = price + 7
                    {if} main {is} pizza price = price + 10
                    {if} main {is} lasagne price = price + 12
                    {if} main {is} spaghetti price = price + 8
                    {if} dessert {is} brownie price = price + 7
                    {if} dessert {is} icecream price = price + 5
                    {if} dessert {is} milkshake price = price + 4
                    {print} 'You have ordered ' starter ' , ' main ' and ' dessert
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                    {print} 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ## Challenge
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?
                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |4

                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?

                    This level has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
                    You can remake your level 3 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 3, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.

                    ## Hack the program
                    Replace Hedy with your own name in the last line, and Hedy will always predict that you will win the lottery and others won't!
                    Of course this might raise some suspicion with the other players... To avoid that, you can make sure that Hedy does give different answers every time you run the code.
                    But of course, still gives you a positive answer and the other players a negative one.

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I can predict how many kids youll get when you grow up!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    siblings = {ask} 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'
                    {sleep}
                    {print} kids ' kids!'
                    ```

                    ## Example Silly Fortune Teller
                    If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I will predict how smart you are!'
                    football = {ask} 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
                    bananas = {ask} 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
                    hygiene = {ask} 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                    result = bananas + hygiene
                    result = result * football
                    {print} 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In this level you can use the `{repeat}` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'

                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'My crystal ball says... ' answer {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ## Challenge
                    As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                    Every time the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                    This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                    By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question_1` , `question_2` and `question_3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                    This does mean that you can only use `{repeat}` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions separately.
                    Can you do it?

                    In the upcoming levels the layout of {repeat} command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                    In the previous levels you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                    Now that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.
                    In the next example you can have your fortune teller {ask} 3 questions and also print them!

                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
                    For example by only having 1 wrong door and 2 correct doors instead of 1 correct door and 2 wrong ones?

                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    Have fun!

                    In this adventure you can program a game of Tic Tac Toe. You can play with two people. Taking turns, you pick a number of the spot (1 - 9) you want to put your sign (x or o) on.
                    The first player that gets 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins!

                    ## Tic Tac Toe
                    In the previous levels the tic tac toe game had an annoying feature. After every move, you had to fill in yourself if you had won or not.
                    This made the game playable, but also quite slow. In this level we have learned the `{elif}` command, that could solve that problem.
                    To use the {elif} to let Hedy check whether or not a player has won is fun, but it also requires a fair amount of extra lines.

                    In the example code you see that we added the requirements to win (3 spots in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
                    You can find them in line 46 to 69. You can see that each time the requirement is met (so if a player has won) the variable game is set to 'over'.
                    This means that the {while} loop will be stopped and the game ends.

                    ## What's next?
                    Congratulations! You've reached the end of level 1. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes, but Hedy has a lot more to discover.

                    In the first level you might've notice that the `{echo}` command can only save one bit of information at a time.
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could {echo} what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome at Hedy's
                    {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {echo} So you want
                    {ask} what would you like to drink?
                    {echo} So you want
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Si le joueur écrit hamburger et coca, tu ne peux pas dire "Alors tu aimerais un hamburger et un coca", mais tu dois le faire sur 2 lignes séparé.
                    Aussi, la commande `{echo}` renvoie seulement le mot à la fin de la phrase. Ainsi, tu ne peux pas dire "ton hamburger arrive de suite !".

                    Ça change au niveau 2. Dans le niveau 2, tu apprendras à travailler avec des variables, ca permet de stocker de multiple informations et de les afficher à la place que tu veux.
                    Alors allons au prochain niveau !

                    ## What's next?
                    In this level you've learned what a variable is and how you can use it to make your adventures more interactive.
                    But... that's not the only thing you can do with variables! You can also use variables to make lists.
                    And you can even let Hedy pick a random word out of a list, which allows you to make real games!
                    Take a quick look at the next level!

                    ## What's next?
                    In this level you've been practising with variables, but maybe you've come across this mistake.

                    Try to run this code:
                    ```
                    name {is} Sophie
                    {print} My name is name
                    ```
                    Of course you wanted to print `My name is Sophie` but Hedy prints `My Sophie is Sophie`.
                    In the next level this problem is fixed by using quotation marks.

                start_code: "{print} Let's go to the next level!"
            4:
                story_text: |
                    ## What's next?
                    In the previous levels you've already learned to use `{at} {random}` which made your games different every time you ran the code.
                    But it's not really interactive, the player doesn't have any influence on what happens in the game.

                    In the next level you'll learn the `{if}` command, that allows you to give different responses in your program. This way you can program a secret password for your computer for example.
                    So let's take a peak!

                    ```
                    password {is} {ask} 'What is the correct password?'
                    ```
                start_code: "{print} 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you've reached the end of this level, so you have learned `{ask}` and `{if}`. For example you can {ask} guests what they would like to eat.
                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    The next level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in the next level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.
                    Go see for yourself in the next level!
                example_code: |
                    ## Free drinks!
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome at McHedy'
                    order {is} {ask} 'What would you like to eat?'
                    {print} 'You would like ' order
                    {if} order {is} hamburger price {is} 5
                    {if} order {is} fries price {is} 2
                    drinks {is} {ask} 'What would you like to drink?'
                    {print} 'You would like ' drinks
                    {print} 'That will be ' price ' dollars for your ' order ' please'
                    {print} 'The drinks are free in this level because Hedy cant calculate the price yet...'
                    ```

                    ## What's next?
                     Great job! You've reached the end of this level, which means you have practiced with `{if}` and `{else}`. You have probably noticed that your codes are getting longer and longer.
                     For example {if} you want to program 'Happy Birthday'.

                    That's a lot of code for mainly the same words over and over again. Luckily in the next level has a solution with the `{repeat}` command, that allows you to repeat a line of code multiple times.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                    {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                    {print} 'happy birthday dear Hedy'
                    {print} 'happy birthday to you'
                    ```

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you've learned how to repeat one single line of code. This comes in handy, but it's not always enough. Sometimes you want to repeat multiple lines at once.
                    the next level allows you to group a couple of lines of code, and repeat that little group of lines all at once!

                    ## What's next?
                    Great job! You've reached the end of another level! In this level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an {if} or {repeat} command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In the next level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer = {ask} 'Would you like to go to the next level?'
                    {if} answer {is} yes
                        {print} 'Great! You can use the {repeat} commando in the {if} command!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                        {print} 'Hooray!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Okay, you can stay here for a little longer!'

                    You're doing great! In this level we still face a small problem. You have learned to repeat lines, but what if you'd want to slightly change the line.
                    For example if you want to sing the song '{if} you're happy and you know it'. It would look like this:

                    If you'd also want the next verse 'stomp your feet', and the next one, and the next one, you'd have to change the code completely.
                    In the next level you'll learn the `{for}` command, which allows you to make a list of actions and repeat the code with another action each time!
                    Please take a look!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times}

                    You have reached the end of this level, you're doing great! You are about to go to the next level. In the higher levels, Hedy is focussing more and more on teaching you the programming language Python.
                    In Python there is no `{repeat}` command, but there is a command that works like {repeat}. Are you curious to find out how to say `{repeat}` in Python language? Quickly go on to find out!

                    Peut-être as-tu essayé d'utiliser un nombre décimal dans ton aventure 'restaurant'. Si c'est le cas, tu as surement remarqué qu'Hedy ne les comprenait pas encore et qu'il arrondissait.
                    À partir du prochain niveau, tu pourra utiliser des nombres décimaux.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    burger is 5
                    boisson is 2
                    total is burger + boisson
                    print 'Tu as commandé un burger et une boisson'
                    print 'Cela coute ' total ' dollars s il te plait'
                    ```
                    Le code ci-dessus fonctionne car un burger coute 5 dollars et une boisson 2 dollars. Mais si on augmente de 50 centimes, le programme de fonctionne plus ! Comme le code ci-dessous :
                    ```
                    burger is 5.50
                    boisson is 2.30
                    total is burger + boisson
                    print 'Tu as commandé un burger et une boisson'
                    print 'Cela coute ' total ' dollars s il te plait'
                    ```

                    In the previous levels you learned how to put two `{if}`commands inside each other. This works fine, but it does give you very long and unhandy codes like this one:

                    In this system you have to give both the correct username and the correct password.
                    In the next level you will learn the `{and}` command that will make this code a ot shorter and more understandable!

                    You can see this code is extremely inefficient, du to the very long code in line 5.
                    All the different grades from 1 to 5 had to be programmed seperately. Lucky for you, in the next level you'll learn how to do this without this extremely long code!

                    You can't play to infinity?

                    This way you can program a code in which the correct animal is matched to the right sound.
                    Because the two codes below... Are obviously nonsense!

                    In the next level it's time for a new command. You might have noticed in the previous levels that `{if}` and `{else}` sometimes aren't enough.
                    For example in this code:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'What is for dinner tonight?'

                    chosen = options {at} {random}
                    {if} chosen = 'pizza'
                        {print} 'Yummy! Pizza!'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Yikes...'
                    ```
                story_text_2: In this code it would be great to have 2x an `{else}` so you could have one option for the broccoli and one for the green beans. The next level comes with the new command `{elif}` that makes this possible! So check out the next level now!
